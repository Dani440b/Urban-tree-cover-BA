# Urban-tree-cover-BA

- The files here are mostly .ipynb notebooks that were made for testing, and might be incomplete in a lot of cases. 
- The .py python files are files made to work for slurm, and might also be somewhat incomplete, since changes can have been made since last use.

## SAM

The sam folder contains different testings of SAM and the notebooks contain a lot of different things. Notably SAM - test 3 and 4 are mostly bounding boxes and the ones before that are mostly point prompt or automatic segmentation files

## Mask2Former

The Mask2Former folder is mostly mask2former but also partly detectron2 testing files. I had to use SLURM for the most part while doing this, so some of the files are made to save images with segmentations in folders (that I could then sync to my laptop).

## Dinov2

the Dinov2 files are incomplete and mostly yaml setup files, as I never got this to work.
